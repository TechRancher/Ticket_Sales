# Ticket_Sales

This is my first Python program I have done on my own. I have taken the idea from my Python Class at Treehouse.

It is a ticket request program. It asked for user interaction by questing for their name.
Then asks the user for how many ticket they want to buy.
Then I calcuate the price of tickets by the number of tickets requested then add a service charge to each transaction.
The information is then displayed for the user to confirm if they wish to purchase. 

Feel free to check it out.
If you find any bugs or whish to help teach me a better way to code. 
Please feel free to let me know.
